JS-YAML - YAML 1.2 parser and serializer for JavaScript
=======================================================

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/nodeca/js-yaml.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/nodeca/js-yaml)
[![NPM version](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/js-yaml.svg)](https://www.npmjs.org/package/js-yaml)

[Online Demo](http://nodeca.github.com/js-yaml/)


This is an implementation of [YAML](http://yaml.org/), a human friendly data
serialization language. Started as [PyYAML](http://pyyaml.org/) port, it was
completely rewritten from scratch. Now it's very fast, and supports 1.2 spec.


Installation
------------

### YAML module for node.js

```
npm install js-yaml
```


### CLI executable

If you want to inspect your YAML files from CLI, install js-yaml globally:

```
npm install -g js-yaml
```

#### Usage

```
usage: js-yaml [-h] [-v] [-c] [-t] file

Positional arguments:
  file           File with YAML document(s)

Optional arguments:
  -h, --help     Show this help message and exit.
  -v, --version  Show program's version number and exit.
  -c, --compact  Display errors in compact mode
  -t, --trace    Show stack trace on error
```


### Bundled YAML library for browsers

``` html
<!-- esprima required only for !!js/function -->
<script src="esprima.js"></script>
<script src="js-yaml.min.js"></script>
<script type="text/javascript">
var doc = jsyaml.load('greeting: hello\nname: world');
</script>
```

Browser support was done mostly for online demo. If you find any errors - feel
free to send pull requests with fixes. Also note, that IE and other old browsers
needs [es5-shims](https://github.com/kriskowal/es5-shim) to operate.

Notes:

1. We have no resourses to support browserified version. Don't expect it to be
   well tested. Don't expect fast fixes if something goes wrong there.
2. `!!js/function` in browser bundle will not work by default. If you really need
   it - load `esprima` parser first (via amd or directly).
3. `!!bin` in browser will return `Array`, because browsers do not support
   node.js `Buffer` and adding Buffer shims is completely useless on practice.
